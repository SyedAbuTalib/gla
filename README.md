# gla

gla stands for "git pull all". When in the parent directory with several repos inside, just run gla and it will pull from master for you.

## How

Just copy and paste the code into your `.zshrc` or your `.bashrc`

## Why

I hate having to cd into every repo and run git pull. I want a single command to do it all.
