# gla

gla stands for "git pull all". When in the parent directory with several repos inside, just run gla and it will pull from master for you.

## How

Just copy and paste the code into your `.zshrc` or your `.bashrc`

## Why

## Visual

This is what it looks like when you run this command: ![Screenshot from 2020-07-09 14-06-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18503982/87080944-28da6500-c1ee-11ea-95c2-596f1d86a54e.png)
